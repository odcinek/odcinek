title: On publishing undeveloped photos
---

I believe that vast majority of photos we consume (and especially the kind I've been shooting lately - namely nightscapes) are overprocessed, to a point of no longer reflecting reality (or even trying to do so). While I acknowledge that as a form of artistict expression and sometimes appreciate the effect - I try to not follow that trend in my own work.

I am not, by any means, a purist. I am not against developing photos - I shoot RAW, and process in Adobe Lightroom for desired effect. I am, however, striving to replicate what the nature presented me (or my camera) with, or at least what I think it was going for.

I strongly believe in glass filters, single exposures (when possible), and minimal adjustements - and for me that's a matter of personal preference and taste.

Could the effects of my night excursions be much more impressive if processed heavilly? Probably yes. Would the milky way *pop* in completely unnatural way? Sure. Would have I enjoyed that process? No, not in the slightest.

Having all that said - publishing both *before* and *after* shots is a form of *me* keeping *myself* in check, and honest to what I'm shooting for. On top of that, I think having an option to compare original material with final result is a great educational opportunity, and helps one to learn discerning what can be achieved in camera (and understanding it's limitations) from post-processing overhaul. We don't get enough exposure to that sort of side-by-side comparisons.

Most of photos I publish here have a *before* and *after* versions (whenever feasible). Having absolutely no adjustements in *before* version is **not** a hard and fast rule of mine - for example lens corrections and vignetting adjustements will get applied to both, as I view them as merely compensating for lenses' shortcomings.
